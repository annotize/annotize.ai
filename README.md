# annotize.github.io website

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node 20

### One-time setup

#### Install dependencies

    script/bootstrap

#### Populate the .gitignore'd .env file

Copy the template to `.env`:

    cp .env.template .env

##### `INPUT_DATA_PATHS`

Modify the `INPUT_DATA_PATHS` to point to one or more RDF files to load into the application. These are typically:

1. An annotations file generated by the annotation process
2. A file with SKOS concepts and concept schemes referenced by annotations

Paths are separated with the platform path separator: `:` on Unix, `;` on Windows. Paths should be absolute.

For example, to load Medline Plus annotations, Medline Plus health topic groups in SKOS, and MeSH in SKOS:

    INPUT_DATA_PATHS=/Users/minor/projects/annotize/annotize/annotations/medline_plus/annotations.ttl:/Users/minor/projects/annotize/annotize/data/medline_plus/mplus_topic_groups_2024-06-06.skos.ttl:/Users/minor/projects/annotize/annotize/data/mesh/mesh2024.skos.ttl

### Running the server in development mode

    npm run dev
